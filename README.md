# Project-1-The-Game
This project is a Tic Tac Toe game board. 

### Motivation
My main motivation behind this project was to attempt to build something simple yet kind of difficult for me. It was mainly difficult 
because I just started my programming journey a couple weeks ago.

### User Stories
I was able to create a wireframe in order to come up with the basic layout of how I imagined my game to be. 

### Credits
I'd have to give many many credit to all the codepen tic tac toe examples I came across. Also the countless Stackoverflow articles that helped me out. 

## Future Developments
I want to make it fully functional as in the win logic and also once I get better in the design aspect, redo the entire styling of the site.
